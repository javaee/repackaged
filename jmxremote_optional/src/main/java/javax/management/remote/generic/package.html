    <title>Generic JMX API Connector</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>The Generic JMX API Connector. This package is an 
       <em>optional package</em> of the JMX Remote API.  
      This package defines a framework
      for JMX API connectors that use the messages defined in the {@link
      javax.management.remote.message} package.  A Generic Connector
      requires a full-duplex transport that can communicate those
      messages from one end to the other, as specified by the interface
      {@link javax.management.remote.generic.MessageConnection
      MessageConnection}.  It can also define an <em>object
	wrapping</em> that controls how to encode objects that should not
      be deserialized until the appropriate class loader is known; this
      is specified by the interface
      {@link javax.management.remote.generic.ObjectWrapping
      ObjectWrapping}.</p>

    <p>The Generic Connector is described in detail in the document
      <em>JMX Remote API</em>.</p>

    <p>The JMXMP Connector is a configuration of the Generic
      Connector where the transport uses Java object serialization over
      a TCP connection, and the object wrapping also uses Java object
      serialization.</p>
