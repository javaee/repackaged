/**
 * <p>A JMX API connector server that creates connections using the JMX
 * Messaging Protocol over TCP.
 * Rather than instantiate this class directly, it is recommended to
 * use the {@link JMXConnectorServerFactory} with a {@link JMXServiceURL}
 * that has protocol type <code>jmxmp</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The address that the connector server should listen for
 * connections on is specified with a {@link JMXServiceURL} provided
 * to the constructor.  If the host is omitted from this address, the
 * local host is understood.  If the port is omitted from this
 * address, the connector server will listen on an unspecified
 * available port.  The {@link #getAddress() getAddress} method can be
 * used to discover which port it is.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the local machine has more than one network interface, it is
 * possible to listen for connections on all of the interfaces, or on
 * just one interface.  By default, a connector server listens on all
 * of the interfaces.  To listen on just one, specify the address of
 * the interface in the <code>JMXServiceURL</code> and supply the
 * attribute {@link #SERVER_ADDRESS_WILDCARD} with the value
 * <code>"false"</code> when constructing the connector server.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition to any protocol-specific authentication, this
 * connector server can verify new connections and/or modify the
 * authenticated {@link Subject} by supplying a {@link
 * JMXAuthenticator} using the attribute {@link #AUTHENTICATOR}.  The
 * {@link JMXAuthenticator#authenticate authenticate} method will be
 * called with a two-element <code>Object[]</code>.  The first element
 * is a String that is the connection id of the new connection.  The
 * second element is either null or the authenticated {@link Subject}.
 * If the connection is accepted, the method returns the
 * <code>Subject</code> to use for received requests, or null if there
 * is none.  If the connection is rejected, the method throws an
 * exception, typically {@link SecurityException}.</p>
